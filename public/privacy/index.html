This Privacy Policy applies to <a href=https://uisuite.io>https://uisuite.io</a> (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "https://uisuite.io"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the Website and does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.</p><p>This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our Website, set forth the general rules and policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our Website, you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.</p><p><h2>Website Visitors</h2><p>Like most website operators, UISuite.io collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. UISuite.io&rsquo;s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how UISuite.io&rsquo;s visitors use its website. From time to time, UISuite.io may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p><p>UISuite.io also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on <a href=https://uisuite.io>https://uisuite.io</a> blog posts. UISuite.io only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p></p><p><h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2><p>Certain visitors to UISuite.io&rsquo;s websites choose to interact with UISuite.io in ways that require UISuite.io to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that UISuite.io gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at <a href=https://uisuite.io>https://uisuite.io</a> to provide a username and email address.</p></p><p><h2>Security</h2><p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p></p><p><h2>Advertisements</h2><p>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by UISuite.io and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p></p><p><h2>Links To External Sites</h2><p>Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us.

Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using UISuite.io&rsquo;s website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. UISuite.io will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, UISuite.io discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when UISuite.io believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of UISuite.io, third parties or the public at large.</p><p>If you are a registered user of <a href=https://uisuite.io>https://uisuite.io</a> and have supplied your email address, UISuite.io may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what&rsquo;s going on with UISuite.io and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. UISuite.io takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p></p><p><h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2><p>UISuite.io may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website.
